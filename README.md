# Interactive Recruited Schools Map
During my time at WestEd, I created this interactive map created using R and Leaflet to help my team visualize our school recruitment efforts. Being able to see where diverse and rural schools were clustered allowed us to target our recruitment efforts to prioritize these schools. 

Diversity status was determined using publicly available NCES data and a threshold set by the research team (roughly 50% or more of students identifying as minority ethnic groups).
